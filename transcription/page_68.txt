Icing:  1 cup sugar (take out 6 tabl. to add
to egg white).  Take the remaining sugar, 1/2
cup water, 1 teas. Karo syrup and cook until
it boils.  Add to beaten egg whites.  Add 1
teas. vanilla flavoring and 3 or 4 marshmellows.

Another method of mixing cake:  Cream shortening
and sugar, then add beaten eggs.  Sift all
dry ingredients together and alternately with
liquid, add prunes and nuts to the mixture and
stir.  Dissolve soda in a very small amount of
warm water, add this last.  Bake in 350Â° oven
for 30 or 40 mtes. or until done.  May be baked
in layers or loaf or muffins.
