½ c. graham cracker crumbs ¼ t. cinnamon
½ c. zwelback crumbs       white of 1 egg
3 T. sugar

Combine, mixing by hand until blended thoroughly.
Grease a spring form pan about 10" wide 3½" deep.
Sprinkle bottom and sides with the crumb mixture,
pressing in place with your hand.  Pour in the
cheese batter.  Bake in a 350 degree oven for 1
hour.  When you take from oven you may think the
cake is a little pale.  Just put it under the
broiler for a few seconds to brown and quickly
pull it out.  Chill thoroughly. Invert on a
lightly greased cooky sheet to unmold it.  Then
invert browned side is up. Serve with strawberry
sauce if you like.
