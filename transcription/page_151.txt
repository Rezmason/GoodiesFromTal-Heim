                   Fix-Ahead Chicken

Skin, halve and remove small rib bones from 6
chicken breats.  Brown in electric skilley or Dutch
oven using a stick of margerine.  Remove from pan
and brown 1 4-oz. can sliced, drained mushrooms.
Add 2 tabl. of flour for each can bouillon used
(2 or 3 cans) and brown flour.  Stir in beff
bouillon and cook until thickened, then add 1
small garlic pod, two bay leaves, 1 tablespoonful
worchestershire sauce.  Return chicken to the pan
and simmer two hours or more.  Serve the gravy over
rice.  This may be made early in the morning, or
even the day before you want to serve it.  It
won't taste "left over".
