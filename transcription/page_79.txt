              SEVEN MINUTE ICING

1 7/8 c. sugar             6 T. water
2 egg whites               2 t. vanilla

Mix sugar, water and egg white. Beat while cooking
over boiling water for seven minutes. Add vanilla
and spread on cake. Use any kind of fruit inbetween
layers and on top.  We like fresh ground coconut.
When using coconut I substitute lemon for the
vanilla both in the cake and icing. Also use the
milk from the coconut as the liquid in the icing.
