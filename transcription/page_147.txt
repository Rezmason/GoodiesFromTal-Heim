          ARROZ CON POLLO CONTINUED

1 tablespoon bijol (spice can be purchased at Bruno's)
Salt and pepper to taste, 3 bay leaves, 1 tablespoon
oregano.

Cook all ingredients together slowly and the rice
will be tender through the juices from the above
ingredients.  When rice is tender you will no longer
have any juice left.

Before serving garnish on top with pimento halves
and slices of hard boiled eggs.  Serves 6 to 8 people.
