                     Fresh Strawberry Pie

1 baked 9" pie shell         1 cup sugar
1/3 cup flour                1 cup boiling water
Chunk of butter              1 cup whipping ream
1 quart strawberries

Mix sugar and flour together in small pan, then add
boiling water slowly while mixing well.  Cook until thick
and remove from burner and add butter and cool.  Fill
pie shell with fresh clean strawberries cut in half
and pour cooled sauce over them.  Mix slightly

increase the sauce by one-half.)
