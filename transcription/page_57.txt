Over this mixture pour four eggs well beaten &
flavoring.  Mix well by hand.  Bake in tube pan in
oven at 275Â° - then set tube pan in a pan of hot
water.  Let water come up about 2 inches on pan.
Cook 2 hours.  Remove from the water and continue
baking for another hour.  Let cool in pan before
removing.  Pour a little wine or brandy over it while
it is warm.

After cake is done, it can be glazed, if desired.
