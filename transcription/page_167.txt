             GREEN BEAN CASSEROLE

1 can French green beans   1 can French Fried
1 can cream of mushroom soup   onion rings

In lightly greased casserole, alternate layers
of drained french green beans (reserving ¼ cup
liquid), and onion rings. Save a few onion rings
to top casserole. Mix ¼ cup bean liquid with
mushroom soup and pour over top. Add few onion
rings. Bake at 350 degrees for about 30 minutes
or until heated through.  Grated cheese can be
used for topping of casserole instead of reserved
onion rings.
